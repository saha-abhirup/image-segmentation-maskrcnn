Segmentation of Breast cancer images using Mask RCNN
In this project, the idea is to segment tumour from medical images like breast cancer MRIs for detecing cancer.  I am primarily using MaskRCNN 
architecture in this project. This architecture can also be extented for classification of cancer in addition to segmentation.
